            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

FAITHFUL TESTIMONY
For the Lord againſt this
Nation of England's
INIQUITY, and IDOLATRY, and OPPRESSION,
Becauſe of which the Land mourneth.
Being alſo a WARNING to all People to conſider what they have done, and what they
are a doing.</head>
            <p>OH All People of the World, Repent, Repent, and turn to the Lord,
leſt his dreadful Judgments fall upon you! All People fear and dread
and ſerve the Living God: And know, that the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth hath cauſed me, <hi>Laurence Taylor</hi> of <hi>Settle,</hi> to go ſeveral Times with
my Body naked, and my outward Viſage or Beauty marred with Grime or
Soot, and Aſhes on my Head: I ſay, the Lord God of Heaven and Earth hath
commanded me ſeveral Times to go into ſeveral Steeple-Houſes in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and through ſeveral Towns, which may ſtand a Sign and a Witneſs againſt
this naked and ſinful Generation, whoſe Worſhip is not in Spirit and Truth,
and Souls not covered with the Spirit of Truth, which the Wo is unto; <hi>For
Wo unto them, who cover, but not with the Covering of my Spirit, ſaith the
Lord,</hi> Iſa. 30. 1: And God will marr their Beauty, and conſume their Glory
into Aſhes: Therefore, all People turn your Minds in, to the Light of Chriſt,
and with it you will ſee how you ſtand in the Sight of the Living God; for
verely, the Lord is grieved with this Generation, and his Spirit is burdened
with the Iniquity of this People, who profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but are <hi>Enemies
to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> and hate the Appearance of his Truth: Therefore in
the Name of the Lord, I warn you, Repent, and turn to the Lord, leſt his
Dreadful Judgments fall upon you; and ſeek the Lord while he is to be found,
leſt the Door be ſhut, and you ſtand without, having ſlighted the Day of your
Viſitation: So while you have Time, prize it; and ſeek the Lord, while
you have a Day and a Time, leſt the Night come in which no Man can work.
This from a Lover of Peoples Souls.</p>
            <p>And upon the <hi>13th</hi> of the <hi>12th</hi> Month, called <hi>February</hi> at Night, 1674.
I was moved by the Lord God to ſhave the Hair of my Head, and burn it; and
theſe Words aroſe in my Heart, <hi>So ſhall the Glory of</hi> Egypt <hi>be conſumed into
Aſhes by the fiery Jealouſie and fierce Indignation of the Wrath of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And on the <hi>14th</hi> Day of the <hi>12th</hi> Month, being firſt Day of the Week, in
Obedience to the Lord God, I went into the great Steeple-Houſe at <hi>Rippon</hi>
(called <hi>Minſter</hi>) with my Body naked (and as above-mentioned) and further
I had to ſignifie unto the chief Worſhippers there, that their Hands are polluted,
their Sacrifices not acceptable with God, their Prayers an Abomination to the
Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſo for going into the Steeple-Houſe at <hi>Rippon</hi> with my Body naked,
and bearing my Teſtimony for the Lord, in being a Sign againſt this naked and
ſinful Generation, their falſe Worſhip, and falſe Worſhippers, was I hurried
to Priſon, and committed Priſoner, as they pretend, for diſturbing them; but
they diſturbed me, who was in the Lord's Service; and for obeying the Voice
of the Lord God, have they cauſed my Body to be detained in outward Bonds;
but with my Spirit I can ſing Praiſes to God for his unlimited Goodneſs, whoſe
Mercy endureth for ever; So ſaith my Soul, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Wo, Wo, unto the falſe Worſhippers, who worſhip not the living God,
and moſt eſpecially, to the Prieſts, Teachers, Leaders and Guiders of this
fooliſh and dark, ignorant and ſottiſh People, who uſually aſſemble at the
great <hi>Minſter</hi> at <hi>Rippon;</hi> as alſo to all other People who are in the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
the Lord is againſt you the falſe Teachers, <hi>who preach for Hire, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
for Money,</hi> and alſo againſt you People who <hi>love to have it ſo;</hi> conſider
your Wayes, you Prieſts and Teachers, <hi>blind Guides, who run, and the Lord
never ſent you, therefore ye ſhall not profit this People at all,</hi> as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 32.
<hi>And one builds a Wall, and lo, others daub it with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntempered Morter, crying,
Peace, Peace,</hi> Ezek. 13. 10. <hi>When the Lord never pronounced it; for there
is no Peace to the Wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> Iſa. 57. 21. Therefore, thus ſaith
the Lord, I am againſt you Prieſts and Teachers of this Nation of <hi>England,</hi>
who cauſe my People to err by your Lyes, and by your Lightneſs or Lewdneſs;
for you ſay, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when the Lord never ſpoak by you; for you ſay
(<hi>Viſions and Revelations are ceaſed,</hi> and you <hi>deny the Teaching of the Holy One,</hi>
and you <hi>teach for Doctrine the Traditions of Men,</hi> and you <hi>lay wait for Blood,</hi>
deceiving the Souls of the ſimple by your Lyes &amp; Deceits; for you <hi>call evil good,
and good you call evil;</hi> you <hi>put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs;</hi> you
<hi>turn the Blind out of the Way,</hi> and you <hi>Blind Guides lead the Blind, ſo both fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ditch</hi> and <hi>Pit,</hi> and into the Snare; and if any one of thoſe whoſe Eyes the
Lord hath opened, bears witneſs againſt you, then <hi>ye prepare War againſt them,
or if they put not into your Mouthes,</hi> Micah 3. 5. Oh! how many of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Lord have you cauſed to ſuffer for their Teſtimonies ſake? ſome
for not paying Tythes, ſome who have been impriſoned till Death, and many
cauſed to ſuffer deeply in their Goods, beſides Violence on the Bodyes of many
uſed; and ſome by hard Uſage and Cruelty have ſuffered Death, and ſealed
their Teſtimony with their Blood, which you are guilty of who continue in
the ſame Spirit, and follow the ſame Practices; you are of them <hi>who lead Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſilly Women laden with Sins and divers Luſts, ever learning, and never able
to come to the true Knowledge of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. You are of them who
<hi>are in the Way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and run greedily after the Error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for Reward,
and periſh in the gain-ſaying of</hi> Core, Jude 11. <hi>But you ſhall not proceed much
further; for your Folly is manifeſt to all</hi> whoſe Eyes the Lord hath opened, to
ſee your Nakedneſs; and your Fig-Leaf-like Profeſſion will not cover you, nor
ſave you from the Wrath of the Almighty God: Therefore, howl, howl,
you falſe Shepherds; lament and weep you blind Guides; for the Lord is
ariſen to render Fury to his Adverſaries, who deſpiſe his Way and Truth, and
<hi>would not have him to reign, whoſe Right it is;</hi> Glory be to his Name forever,
who is God over all.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the Name of the Lord I warn you falſe Teachers and blind Guides
to ceaſe deceiving the People, leſt you be farther guilty of the Blood of Souls.</p>
            <p>And alſo to you the <hi>Magiſtrates and Rulers</hi> in this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> who
have made Laws to take hold of the Innocent, this is the Word of the Lord
unto you, <hi>I am againſt you,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>who perſecute the Juſt;</hi> therefore
take heed how you hearken to the murdering Spirit of the Prieſts, who ſtir up
the Powers of the Earth to defend them, and to perſecute the Juſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
People of God. Oh! but conſider how it was the chief Prieſts that
ſtirred up the Officers, and cryed to <hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie Chriſt; and the ſame
Spirit is in the Prieſts and Teachers of this Nation of <hi>England</hi> at this Day:
and ſo in the Name of the Lord, I warn you chief Magiſtrates and Judges, or
any other, take heed how you make Laws, or inflict them upon the innocent
People of God, called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for the Lord's Controverſie is great with this
Nation of <hi>England;</hi> and Wo unto them who are found fighting againſt the
Lord in this the Day of his Power, in which there ſhall be nothing able to ſtand
before the Lord, which is not of him; for he is King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, and the Earth is the Lords and the Fulneſs thereof, and he gives it to
whom he pleaſes, and he can pull down whom he pleaſes, and exalt whom he
pleaſes; therefore let all fear him who made Heaven and Earth and all that is
therein, in whoſe Hands is the <hi>Breath of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> Glory and End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Praiſes be to his Holy Name forever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
